# Weld defect classification with Machine Learning

This repository includes general information and notes relevant to image classification using machine learning

## General overview of the issue
Weld defects can occur due to numerous and various reasons, which will be discussed here later. There are many types of weld defect, but the ones that we are interested in are the following: Crack (CR), Porosity (PO), Undercut (UC), Incomplete Penetration (IP), Slag (Sl) and Lack of Fusion (LF). They may be later referred to by the given acronyms.

### Crack
**Causes:**
* Use of hydrogen when welding ferrous metals.
* Residual stress caused by the solidification shrinkage.
* Base metal contamination.
* High welding speed but low current.
* No preheat before starting welding.
* Poor joint design.
* A high content of sulfur and carbon in the metal.

### Porosity
**Causes:**
* Inadequate electrode deoxidant.
* Using a longer arc.
* The presence of moisture.
* Improper gas shield.
* Incorrect surface treatment.
* Use of too high gas flow.
* Contaminated surface.
* Presence of rust, paint, grease or oil.

### Undercut
**Causes:**
* Too high weld current.
* Too fast weld speed.
* The use of an incorrect angle, which will direct more heat to free edges.
* The electrode is too large.
* Incorrect usage of gas shielding.
* Incorrect filler metal.
* Poor weld technique.

### Incomplete Penetration
**Causes:**
* There was too much space between the metal you’re welding together.
* You’re moving the bead too quickly, which doesn’t allow enough metal to be deposited in the joint.
* You’re using a too low amperage setting, which results in the current not being strong enough to properly melt the metal.
* Large electrode diameter.
* Misalignment.
* Improper joint.

### Slag Inclusion
**Causes:**
* Improper cleaning.
* The weld speed is too fast.
* Not cleaning the weld pass before starting a new one.
* Incorrect welding angle.
* The weld pool cools down too fast.
* Welding current is too low.

### Lack of Fusion

**Causes:**
* Low heat input.
* Surface contamination.
* Electrode angle is incorrect.
* The electrode diameter is incorrect for the material thickness you’re welding.
* Travel speed is too fast.
* The weld pool is too large and it runs ahead of the arc.
