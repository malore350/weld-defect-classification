# Weld defect classification with Machine Learning

This repository includes general information and notes relevant to image classification using machine learning

## General overview of the issue
Weld defects can occur due to numerous and various reasons, which will be discussed here later. There are many types of weld defect, but the ones that we are interested in are the following: Crack (CR), Porosity (PO), Undercut (UC), Incomplete Penetration (IP), Slag (Sl) and Lack of Fusion (LF). They may be later referred to by the given acronyms.

### Crack
** Causes: **
* Use of hydrogen when welding ferrous metals.
* Residual stress caused by the solidification shrinkage.
* Base metal contamination.
* High welding speed but low current.
* No preheat before starting welding.
* Poor joint design.
* A high content of sulfur and carbon in the metal.
